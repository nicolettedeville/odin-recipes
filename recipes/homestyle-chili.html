    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Homestyle chili is a basic chili with ground beef and beans cooked in a beefy and broth with chili spices. My classic homestyle chili has ground beef, tomatoes and 3 types of beans. It can be made in around 45 minutes for a quick weeknight meal or slow simmered to develop the flavors if you have more time. Chili tastes even better the next day, so I usually make a double batch so we have plenty of leftovers and some to freeze for later too.</p>
