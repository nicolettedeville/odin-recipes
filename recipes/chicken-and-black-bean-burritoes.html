    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This recipe is really delishious. I discovered
         it one day while trying to think of something
          different to make for dinner. I always had made traditional
        refried bean and beaf burritoes. I decided there needed to
         be a change and I found this receipe. It is cooked chicken and black beans, either canned or dried.
